- 👋 Hi, I’m Marie
- 👀 I love all types of coding: competitions, machine learning, software design, web design, data analysis/visualization, and learning new things! Even better if it has something to do with biology.
- 🌱 Recently started learning Blender and Unity
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on projects because I have lots of free time now that I graduated from McGill University with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Biology.
