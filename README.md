- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScienceMoo
- 👀 I just love all types of coding: competitions, data analysis/visualization, machine learning, software design, web design, I can't choose! Even better if it has something to do with biology, anything from genetics to ecology to ecosystems I have experience coding with.
- 🌱 Recently started learning Blender and Unity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects, because I will have lots of free time now that I'm graduating.
