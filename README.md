- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScienceMoo
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things related to game development: art, scripting, procedural generation, artificial intelligence, etc. I'm also interested in plants genetics, biology and evolution.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blender
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects, because I will have lots of free time now that I'm graduating.
