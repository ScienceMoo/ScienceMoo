- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marie
- ðŸŒ± I love all types of coding: machine learning, software engineering, web development, data analysis! I also have an interest in biology and love to find ways to use code in real world applications.
- ðŸ‘€ I am always on the lookout for new methods and tools to quickly turn my abundant creative visions into working code
